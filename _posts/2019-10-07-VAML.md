title: (CGF2017) VizML, A Machine Learning Approach to Visualization Recommendation
---

Visual analytics systems combine machine learning or other analytic techniques with interactive data visualization to promote sensemaking and analytical reasoning. It is through such techniques that people can make sense of large, complex data. While progress has been made, the tactful combination of machine learning and data visualization is still under-explored. This state-of-the-art report presents a summary of the progress that has been made by highlighting and synthesizing select research advances. Further, it presents opportunities and challenges to enhance the synergy between machine learning and visual analytics for impactful future research directions.

## Methods
The paper discusses three categories of models: human reasoning, visual analytics and information visualization, and machine learning, Then, it categorizes the integration of machine learning techniques into visual analytic systems and discusses how such systems have been used in specific domains to solve real-world challenges, including
* Text Analytics and Topic Modeling
* Multimedia Visual Analytics
* Streaming Data: Finance, Cyber Security, Social Media
* Biological Data
Finally, open challenges and opportunities for ML and VA are discussed.

Papers are reviewed by scanning resources from both the visualisation and machine learning domain. Within the domain of visualisation, the survey starts with publications from the following resources:
* Journals: IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, Computer Graphics Forum, IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, Information Visualization
* Conferences: IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (partially published as a special issue of IEEE TVCG), IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis) (published as a special issue of IEEE TVCG since 2006), IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis), EuroVis workshop on Visual Analytics (EuroVA)
Within the domain of machine learning, the survey starts with publications from the following resources:
* Journals: Journal of Machine Learning Research, Neurocomputing, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering
* Conferences: International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning (ESANN)
The relevant papers identified in the above resources are scanned and a backward and forward literature investigation was performed using Google Scholar.

## Taxonomy of VAML
A 2D categorization organizes the literatures along two perspectives: Algorithm Type (rows) and Interaction Intent (columns).

## Open Challenges and Opportunities for VAML
### Creating and Training Models from User Interaction Data
How to incorporate user feedback into computation in an effective and expressive, yet usable manner?

The concept of interactive machine learning has taken into account user feedback to steer and train these models. For example, users can provide positive or negative feedback to give support for or against suggestions or classifications made by the model. The models adjust over time based on this input.

### Balancing Human and Machine Effort, Responsibility, and Tasks
For mixed-initiative systems, it is a common notion that there exists a balance of effort between the user and the machine. However, there remains the need for generalizable empirical evidence to inform researchers about how to balance this effort between the user and the machine. It is not clear the extent to which tasks should be divided, or co-completed. Typical data analysis sessions involve many user tasks and sub-tasks, and dividing the effort of these tasks between the user and the system is challenging. It is also unclear exactly how to measure the amount of effort expended by both the user and the system.

### Complex Computation Systems can lead to Automation Surprise
By coupling machine learning with visual analytics systems, we can develop complex systems made up of many interrelated and inter-dependent "black boxes" of automated components for data analysis, knowledge discovery and extraction.

### Visualizing Intermediate Results and Computational Process
A promising topic, involving innovation by both VA and ML communities, is rendering visualizations of the intermediate results during convergence, allowing the user to tunesteer the ML algorithms by changing these elements. Designing ad hoc ML algorithms with this approach in mind that pave the way for new and useful kinds of interaction mechanisms opens new and exciting research paths.

### Enhancing Trust and Interpretability
A key element of the visualization approach is its ability to generate trust in the user. Unlike pure machine learning techniques, in a data visualization the user "sees" the data and information as a part of the analysis. When the visualization is interactive, the user will be part of the loop and involved in driving the visualization. In such a context, the development of a mental model goes hand in hand with the visualization, as everything is part of the process. This tight involvement of the user in the development of the visualization based on the results of previous iterations, along with the highly visual component of human thinking, can make this approach generate a great amount of trust in the user.

### Beyond Current Methods
Consideration of the role of the user opens up several new fields of study where machine learning can play an important role. First amongst these is the role of machine learning in creating a computational model for the user's analytical process. This complements cognitive task analysis and aims to model how domain expert users use visual analytics to tackle important tasks, and how they reason about the problem. This will enable better system design to support expert strategies and provide support to less-trained users.
