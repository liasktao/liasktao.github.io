title: (CHI2019) VizML, A Machine Learning Approach to Visualization Recommendation
---

## Problem statment and background
Visualization recommender systems aim to lower the barrier to exploring basic visualizations. Most recommender systems encode visualization guidelines as collection of “if-then” statements, or rules, to automatically generate visualizations for analysts to search and select, rather than manually specify. these rule-based approaches face limitations such as costly rule creation and the combinatorial explosion of possible results
## Method
