title: (CHI2019) VizML, A Machine Learning Approach to Visualization Recommendation
---

## Problem statment and background
Visualization recommender systems aim to lower the barrier to exploring basic visualizations.
Most recommender systems encode visualization guidelines as collection of “if-then” statements, or rules, to automatically generate visualizations for analysts to search and select, rather than manually specify.
These rule-based approaches face limitations such as costly rule creation and the combinatorial explosion of possible results.
In contrast, machine learning (ML)-based systems directly learn the relationship between data and visualizations by training models on analyst interaction.
Existing systems do not learn to make visualization design choices as an analyst would, which impacts interpretability and ease of integration into existing systems. 
Furthermore, because these systems are trained with annotations on rule-generated visualizations in controlled settings, they are limited by the quantity and quality of data.
